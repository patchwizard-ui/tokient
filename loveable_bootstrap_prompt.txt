Please update the Tokient Insight Stream backend to enforce API key authentication using a Bearer token.
- Security scheme: BearerAuth (see openapi.yaml).
- Public: GET /api/health
- Protected: POST /api/log, GET /api/stats
- Validate that the provided API key exists, is 'active', and is authorized for the requested `project_id` (if present); otherwise return 403.
- When REQUIRE_API_KEY=false, allow requests without auth (for local/testing).
- Read allowed origins from ALLOWED_ORIGINS; apply CORS.
- Keep the JSON schema validation for /api/log and continuous date bucket logic for /api/stats.
